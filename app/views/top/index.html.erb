  <h1>Welcome to NigoroJr.com!</h1>

  <p>The "Articles" page contains things that I discovered while configuring, installing, and developing softwares. However, it's (supposedly) not limited to computer stuff.</p>
  <p>"Products" page is a collection of apps that we developed/are developing.</p>
  <p>"Gallery" has photos that I took in the game Gran Turisumo. Some of them are from GT5 and others are from GT6.</p>
